<h1>Qrochet Formatting</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Descriptions or comments for Qrochet, may a use special text
format, which will be shown as a formatted document.
</p>

<p>
The format is similar to Markdown, but is simplified. It is the same
formats as is used by the <a htef="https://tip.golang.org/doc/comment">
Go programming language for documentation</a>. This description
is based on the linked document.
</p>

<p>
Qrochet descriptions are written in a simple text format that supports
paragraphs, headings, links, lists, and preformatted blocks.
To keep comments lightweight and readable,
there is no support for complex features like font changes or raw HTML.
</p>

<p>Table of Contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#paragraphs">Paragraphs</a></li>
<li><a href="#headings">Headings</a></li>
<li><a href="#links">Links</a></li>
<li><a href="#lists">Lists</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
<p>A paragraph is a span of unindented non-blank lines.</p>
<p>A pair of consecutive backticks (` U+0060)
is interpreted as a Unicode left quote (“ U+201C),
and a pair of consecutive single quotes (' U+0027)
is interpreted as a Unicode right quote (” U+201D).</p>
<h2 id="headings">Headings</h3>
<p>A heading is a line beginning with a number sign (# U+0023) and then a space and the heading text.
To be recognized as a heading, the line must be unindented and set off from adjacent paragraph text
by blank lines.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
# This is a heading

This is a paragraph.
It has two lines.
...
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand:</p>
<pre><code>// #This is not a heading, because there is no space.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// # because it is multiple lines.
//
// # This is not a heading,
// because it is also multiple lines.
//
// The next paragraph is not a heading, because there is no additional text:
//
// #
//
// In the middle of a span of non-blank lines,
// # this is not a heading either.
//
//     # This is not a heading, because it is indented.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="links">Links</h3>
<p>A span of unindented non-blank lines defines link targets
when every line is of the form “[Text]: URL”.
In other text in the same doc comment,
“[Text]” represents a link to URL using the given text—in HTML,
&lt;a href=&ldquo;URL&rdquo;&gt;Text&lt;/a&gt;.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>
This is a link to [YouTube] inside a paragraph.

And this is a link to [Google].

[YouTube]: https://youtube.com
[Google]: https://google.com
</code></pre>
<p>By keeping URLs in a separate section,
this format only minimally interrupts the flow of the actual text.
It also roughly matches the Markdown
<a href="https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#shortcut-reference-link" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">shortcut reference link format</a>,
without the optional title text.</p>
<p>If there is no corresponding URL declaration,
then (except for doc links, described in the next section)
“[Text]” is not a hyperlink, and the square brackets are preserved
when displayed.
Each doc comment is considered independently:
link target definitions in one comment do not affect other comments.</p>
<p>Plain text that is recognized as a URL is automatically linked in HTML renderings.</p>
<h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
<p>A list is a span of indented or blank lines
(which would otherwise be a block, as described in the next section)
in which the first indented line begins with
a bullet list marker or a numbered list marker.</p>
<p>A bullet list marker is a star, plus, dash, or Unicode bullet
(*, +, -, •; U+002A, U+002B, U+002D, U+2022)
followed by a space or tab and then text.
In a bullet list, each line beginning with a bullet list
marker starts a new list item.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
This is a paragraph followed by an unordered list:

   - This is the first list item.
   - This is the second list item.
   - This is the third list item.

</code></pre>
<p>A numbered list marker is a decimal number of any length
followed by a period or right parenthesis, then a space or tab, and then text.
In a numbered list, each line beginning with a number list marker starts a new list item.
Item numbers are left as is, never renumbered.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>
This is a paragraph followed by an ordered list:

   1. This is the first list item.
   2. This is the second list item.
   3. This is the third list item.
</code></pre>
<p>List items only contain paragraphs, not code blocks or nested lists.
This avoids any space-counting subtlety as well as questions about
how many spaces a tab counts for in inconsistent indentation.</p>
<p>Rewriting the text to avoid nested lists usually
improves the documentation and is the best solution.
Another potential workaround is to mix list markers,
since bullet markers do not introduce list items in a numbered list,
nor vice versa.
For example:</p>
<pre><code>
Here is a list:

  1. Item 1.

     - Subitem 1.

     - Subitem 2.

  2. Item 2.

  3. Item 3.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="block">Blocks</h3>
<p>A block is a span of indented or blank lines
not starting with a bullet list marker or numbered list marker.
It is rendered as preformatted text (a &lt;pre&gt; block in HTML).</p>
<p>Blocks contain preformatted text. For example:</p>
<pre><code>
    This is a block.
    It will keep its formatting and new lines.
</code></pre>

</body>
</html>
